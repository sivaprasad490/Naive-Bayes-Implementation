# Naive-Bayes-Implementation
This is a naive bayes implementation of the IRIS data set. I have tried dropping columns in the dataset using a loop and then checking for accuracy. This was done to identify the best set of attributes (Wanted to also check if it is the same output when you do a correlation matrix & do feature selection)
